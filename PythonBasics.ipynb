        "              **Python Basics Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is popular because of its ease of learning, extensive libraries, cross-platform compatibility, and strong community support.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line rather than compiling the entire code at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Pre-defined keywords are reserved words in Python with specific meanings, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names as they have special meanings in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Mutability refers to whether an objectâ€™s value can be changed after creation. Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Lists allow modification of their elements, whereas tuples do not allow modifications after creation. This is due to the way they are implemented in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between `==` and `is` operators in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - `==` checks if two values are equal.  \n",
        "   - `is` checks if two objects refer to the same memory location.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?  \n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Logical operators include `and`, `or`, and `not`. They are used to combine conditional statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Type casting is converting a variable from one data type to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - Implicit casting is done automatically by Python (e.g., `int` to `float`).  \n",
        "    - Explicit casting is done manually using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?  \n",
        "    \n",
        "    - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to make decisions in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the `elif` statement work?  \n",
        "    \n",
        "    - The `elif` statement provides multiple conditions to check when the `if` condition is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between `for` and `while` loops?\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - `for` loops iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string,etc.).  \n",
        "    - `while` loops run as long as a condition is `True`.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a `while` loop is more suitable than a `for` loop.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    - A `while` loop is better when the number of iterations is unknown, such as reading user input until they enter `quit`.\n",

        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Convert user input to integer, float, and boolean**\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   user_input = input(\"Enter a number: \")\n",
        "   print(int(user_input), float(user_input), bool(user_input))\n",
